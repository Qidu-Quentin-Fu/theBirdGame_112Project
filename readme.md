##**Title and description:**

###**Title:**
This term project titled “A Game of Flying Birds”  
(in the 112TermProject.py)
is based on the scaffolded project developed by Mike 
(15112 instructor, Mike hereafter), 
which originates from the bee game, 
the Google Doodle for Earth Day 2020.

###**Brief Description: **
This term project uses the main ideas 
from the scaffolded project developed by Mike. 
Thus, it contains three main components: 
1) the main flying bird (player flying bird, as Mike calls it player bee) 
moves along the cursor and collects the pollen and pollinate flowes
(I know that it may not make sense to relate birds with pollination, 
but I do not like bees.), 
2) two flying birds (helper flying bird, as Mike calls it) 
automatically help the main flying bird to collect the pollen
and pollinate flowers.
3) flowers: generate flowers every five steps 
within a max of 20 flowers on screen.The off-screened flowers are removed.
Each pollinator (flower) can be gathered twice, 
but each pollinated flower can only be pollinated once

##**How to run the project:**

To run this project, you will need to put the birdPic.png, the 112TermProject.py, 
and cmu_graphics into the same folder/directory. 
And then, open the 112TermProject.py file in your text editor, such as VScode, 
To run the project, you should press command + B in Mac.


Which libraries you're using that need to be installed:
As stated, you will need to use cmu_graphics to run the project. 
Thus make sure to download it and put it into the same folder with 
the 112TermProject.py and birdPic.png. 
All other libraries are Python built-in libraries, such as random/math. 


##**A list of any shortcut commands that exist:**
1) Move your cursor have to the player bird's feet to gather/pollinate flowers
2) Press p to pause the game
3) Press p to unpause the game
4) Press h to get helper birds
5) Press r to restart the game

After your press the these keys, and within 1050 steps (maybe 1.5 minutes), you should see all the major features.
